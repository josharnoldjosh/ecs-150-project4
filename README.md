ECS 150 - Project 4.

## Internal VM File functions
These are copies from my project 3 VM File functions. This is so I can reuse them for project 4.

## Piazza questions asked
* What should the types of the fields of the BPB be?
* Reading in BPBâ€”what should we pass in for *data and *length?
* How to call the project 3 VMFileOpen?
* Do we use the VM functions or the lower level Machine functions for reading in the BPB?
* Where is the BPB file located?
